      <p>Originally, <code>HTML</code> was developed with the intent of defining the structure of documents like headings, paragraphs, lists, and so forth to facilitate the sharing of scientific information between researchers.
      </p>
        Now, HTML is being widely used to format web pages with the help of different tags available in HTML <code>language</code>.
      <p>
        HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, and it is the most widely used language to write Web Pages.

      <p> An <code>HTML</code> editor is a program for editing HTML, the markup of a web page. Although the <code>HTML</code> markup in a web page can be controlled with any text editor, specialized HTML editors can offer convenience and added functionality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Text editors intended for use with HTML usually provide at least syntax highlighting. Some editors additionally feature templates, toolbars and keyboard shortcuts to quickly insert common HTML elements and structures. Wizards, tooltip prompts and autocompletion may help with common tasks.

        In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.[3] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. 
      </p>
      <p>That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes from 1990 he listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used" and put an encyclopedia first.</p>

        An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag.The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:
      </p>
      <p>
        HTML elements can be nested (elements can contain elements). All HTML documents consist of nested HTML elements.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Attributes">
      <header>Attributes</header>
      <p>
        Attributes define additional characteristics or properties of the element such as width and height of an image. Attributes are always specified in the start tag (or opening tag) and usually consists of name/value pairs like <code>name="value"</code>. Attribute values should always be enclosed in quotation marks.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are several attributes in HTML5 that do not consist of name/value pairs but consists of just name. Such attributes are called Boolean attributes. Examples of some commonly used Boolean attributes are <code class="code">checked</code>, <code>disabled</code>, <code>readonly</code>, <code>required</code>, etc.
